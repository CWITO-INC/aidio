## Note for Gemini

Do not restart the services with `docker-compose up --build` after making changes. The user will handle this manually.

Do not modify the `.env` file in any way.

Do not ask the user "anything else?" at the end of your turn.

Always read a file before making edits to it, as the user may have made edits in between.
